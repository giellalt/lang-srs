NOTES ON DENE FST MODEL
=======================

Verbs in the lexicon are represented according to the following schema:

    LEMMA[GLOSS]:DERIVATIONAL_MORPHEMES  INFLECTION_PATTERN

For instance, a verb like "cry" that can be inflected in at least four
different aspects (non-past/imperfective (IPFV), past/perfective (PFV),
progressive (PROG), and repetitive (REP)), is laid out as follows:

    itsiy[cry]:tsiy                          INTR-0-IPFV;
    itsiy[cry]:tsày                          INTR-yi-y-PFV;
    itsiy[cry]:tsíł                          INTR-yi-PROG;
    itsiy[cry]:ná=chish                      INTR-0-IPFV;

Taking a closer look at each of these fields individually:

    1. LEMMA: In all of these forms, the imperfective 3SG.SBJ form of the
       verb (itsiy 's/he is crying') is used as the lemma.

    2. GLOSS: An English-language tag for this lemma.  Words in multi-word
       glosses are separated by hyphens (e.g., "[wake-up]", "[run-away]").

    3. DERIVATIONAL_MORPHEMES: The morphemes required to express the lexical
       meaning of this verb, as well as markers indicating where different
       kinds of inflection is expected to appear within this word.

       In Dene languages, lexical meaning can be expressed either in single
       stems, or through fixed, (semi-)arbitrary collocations of prefixes and
       stems.  In (1), the stem -tsiy stands on its own to convey the lexical
       meaning "cry", while in (2), several additional prefixes are required
       to express the meaning "jump down":

        (1)                   -tsiy   --> "cry" (non-past/imperfective)
        (2) nà- + gu- + di- + -tłod   --> "jump down" (non-past/imperfective)
            LEXICAL PREFIXES   STEM

       (Some people have suggested that it might be appropriate to think of
        these collocations as discontiguous, multi-part stems, or have compared
        them to phrasal verbs in English, where otherwise free-standing lexemes
        (e.g., "put" + "down") are combined non-compositionally to express
        other meanings (e.g., "put down" = "insult"). In Dene languages, the
        prefixes that appear in these constructions may bear some resemblance
        to other prefixes that have an identifiable lexical meaning, or may
        only ever appear in collocation with a certain stem.  What's important
        here is the idea that prefix-stem combinations are often arbitrary,
        and together make up the basic meaning of the verb.)

       This use of multi-morpheme collocations is an extremely common strategy
       for expressing lexical meaning in Dene languages, and consequently
       needs to be reflected in FST modelling.

       Although it's not difficult to define entries in a Dene FST lexicon as
       "stem + zero or more lexically-associated prefixes", the morphological
       structure of Dene verbs introduces an additional wrinkle for modelling.
       Since morphemes from anywhere in the verb can be co-opted into these
       arbitrary lexical combinations, it often happens that inflectional
       markers appear between lexical prefixes at different points within the
       verb word.  To show where these inflectional markers should go, each
       DERIVATIONAL_MORPHEMES string also includes up to three boundary
       symbols:

            .   marks where _inner prefixes_ should appear (the portmanteau
                subject person-number-aspect forms that appear immediately
                before the verb stem; see below)

            _   marks where _middle prefixes_ should appear (the direct
                object markers and the third person plural/fourth person
                subject prefixes)

            =   marks where _outer prefixes_ should appear (the distributive
                plural marker dà-)

       (Importantly, each of these sets of affixes is defined in its own
        lexicon.  Inner affixes are laid out in "verb_inner_affixes.lexc",
        middle affixes in "verb_middle_affixes.lexc", and outer affixes in
        "verb_outer_affixes.lexc".  This allows for a degree of modularity
        in the overall design of the FST, keeping the main lexicon relatively
        clean and concise.  More information about how these affix lexica fit
        into the overall picture of the model is given below.)

       In a form like "jump down" (non-past/imperfective), all three of these
       boundary symbols are used to show where inflectional markers should be
       interleaved between the lexical prefixes:

            nàgudiitłod[jump-down]:nà=gu_di.tłod     INTR-0i-IPFV;
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

       In a form like "cry" (non-past/imperfective), where there are no lexical
       prefixes, no boundary marker symbols are needed in the lexical entry.
       Here, it's assumed that all of the inflectional prefixes will appear in
       front of the stem:

            itsiy[cry]:tsiy                          INTR-0-IPFV;
                       ^^^^

       More information about how these boundary symbols are treated in the
       model and how inflection is introduced follows below.

    4. INFLECTION_PATTERN: A continuation lexicon that defines how this
       lexeme will be inflected.  Importantly, the continuation lexica used
       to specify inflectional patterns do not insert the inflectional
       morphemes themselves.  Instead, each INFLECTION_PATTERN lexicon
       sets flags that indicate

        (1) The argument structure of the verb ("valence" -- whether or not
            this verb is impersonal, intransitive, transitive, ditransitive,
            etc.)

        (2) The aspect/mode of the verb (here, non-past/imperfective (IPFV),
            past/perfective (PFV), progressive (PROG), repetitive (REP), or
            potential (POT))

        (3) The auxiliary that is used for subject person-number and aspect
            inflection in the syllable immediately preceding the verb stem.

            In Dene languages, the inflection that appears in the pre-stem
            syllable is often analyzed as being morphologically complex,
            typically representing a combination of 4-6 distinct morphemes.
            In this model, this pre-stem inflection is not fully decomposed
            into its component morphological parts, but rather treated as
            forming several distinct sets of portmanteau inflectional markers.
            Each portmanteau inflectional marker in these paradigms includes
            several pieces of information:

                * Subject person and number
                * Aspect and mode;
                * Conjugation class (i.e., si-, ni-, yi-, or none, representing
                  one of the historical Dene aspect/conjugation class markers)
                * Voice/valence (i.e., the historical voice/valence markers
                  or "classifiers" that fuse phonologically with the preceding
                  prefixes)

            By treating this inflection as "chunks", rather than as sequences
            of discrete (and often highly abstract) morphemes, we avoid much
            of the phonological machinery that is otherwise needed to compose
            inflection in this part of the Dene verb.  In practice, the
            paradigms that emerge under this analysis closely resemble an
            auxiliary system: each verb stem is lexically associated with a
            corresponding auxiliary that provides the forms needed to express
            the above inflectional information.

            Importantly, the forms that each auxiliary takes often depends on
            what kind of prefix appears immediately before it -- if there is
            no preceding prefix, or an inner/middle prefix, or an outer prefix
            can make a significant difference in the phonological shape of the
            auxiliary.  This allomorphy means that we need to keep track of
            what kinds of lexical prefixes show up before the auxiliary; more
            on how this is handled below.

Given a set of lexical entries containing all of this information, how does
this model produce/recognize the corresponding inflectional forms?  As was
mentioned above, the main verbal lexicon only contains information about

    (a) the derivational parts in the verb,
    (b) where inflection should appear amidst these parts (the boundary
        markers =, _, and .), and
    (c) what inflectional patterns should be followed.

The inflectional affixes themselves are defined in separate lexica that are
implemented outside of the lexicon containing the verb lexemes.  This
separation makes for looser coupling between the inflectional and derivational
parts of the final FST (and an easier-to-read verb lexicon), but requires some
additional steps to connect all of the component FSTs.  There are three small
'tricks' that make this separation between inflection and derivation possible
in the current model:

    1. When the model reads in the DERIVATIONAL_MORPHEMES part of each lexical
       entry, it makes note of any boundary markers that are present and
       inserts a corresponding flag in the entry:

            BOUNDARY MARKER IN LEXEME             FLAG INSERTED
            =========================             =============
                       =                 -->     @P.PREFIX.OUTER@
                       _                 -->     @P.PREFIX.MIDDLE@
                       .                 -->     @P.PREFIX.INNER@

       Recall that auxiliaries typically have different forms depending on the
       kinds of lexical prefixes that appear in front of them -- they have
       different allomorphs when preceded by an outer prefix vs. a middle/inner
       prefix vs. no prefix at all.  These flags allow us to make sure that the
       correct form of the auxiliary is inserted into the lexeme later on, 
       letting us know what kinds of lexical prefixes are present in the verb.

    2. Once those flags have been inserted, we insert the . (inner prefix),
       _ (middle prefix), and = (outer prefix) boundary markers into the
       lexical entry string, if any of them weren't already present.  This
       step allows us to keep our lexical entries slim, including boundary
       markers only when there are prefixes that come before them, while still
       letting the model know where inflection should be added later on:

         DERIV. MORPHEMES         EXPANSION
         ================         =========
            tsiy            -->   =_.tsiy       [No boundary markers present,
                                                 =, _, and . added]
            di.tł'áh        -->   =_di.tł'áh    [Only inner prefix di- present,
                                                 = and _ added]
            gu_náh          -->   =gu_.náh      [Only middle prefix gu- present,
                                                 = and . added]
            ts'á=zíd        -->   ts'á=_.zíd    [Only outer prefix ts'á present,
                                                 _ and . added]
            nà=gu_di.tłod   -->   nà=gu_di.tłod [All boundary markers present,
                                                 none inserted]

    3. Now that we know what lexical prefixes are present and where all of
       the inflectional information should be added, we can stitch in the
       affix lexica, allowing them to expand the lexemes at each of the
       boundary points.  This is accomplished by replacing each boundary
       marker with the corresponding affix lexicon:

            BOUNDARY MARKER IN LEXEME             REPLACEMENT LEXICON
            =========================             ===================
                       =                 -->    verb_outer_affixes.lexc
                       _                 -->    verb_middle_affixes.lexc
                       .                 -->    verb_inner_affixes.lexc

       (In other words, wherever the '=' symbol occurred in the original verb
        stem lexicon, all of the nodes and paths from the outer affix FST get
        inserted at that point, and likewise for the other boundary symbols /
        affix lexica)

       Importantly, the affix lexica that get inserted at the boundary symbols
       make use of the same flags as the main lexicon.  In that way, entries
       in the verb lexicon are able to lead into the correct paths for their
       inflection.  For instance, an entry that contains a boundary marker
       will get the corresponding @R.PREFIX flag (cf. #1 above), and the affix
       lexica can use that information to select the right set of allomorphs
       for their inflection.

All three of these steps are implemented in 'verbtest.foma'.
